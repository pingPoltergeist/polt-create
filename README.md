### Installation

1. Generate an SSH key and add the PUBLIC KEY to your GitHub account. Make sure that your account has access to the in-house repository of polt-create
   
   <br>
   
2. In your local machine, open up a terminal with superuser or administrator rights. We need to install the package globally. So run the command 
`npm install -g git@github.com:pingPoltergeist/polt-create.git`

3. You would normally be prompted to log in to your GitHub account multiple times during installation. After that the package would be installed successfully and will be ready to use.

2. **React App:** To create a React application, navigate to the project directory (ideally empty) and run the command in a shell `polt-create reactApp`. File structure would be generated and dependencies would be installed. Then the application would automatically open up in a browser window.

3. **Next App (soon):** To create a Next JS application, navigate to the project directory (ideally empty) and run the command in a shell `polt-create nextApp`. File structure would be generated and dependencies would be installed. Then the application would automatically open up in a browser window.
